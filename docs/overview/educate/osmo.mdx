# The OSMO Token

The OSMO token is a governance token that allows staked token holders to decide the future of the protocol, including every implementation detail. OSMO is currently used for the following (although governance is free to add or remove these functions):

## Voting
Governance is the critical component of how Osmosis evolves. Active stakeholders of the network will be responsible for proposing, vetting, and passing protocol upgrades.

The pools eligible for liquidity rewards are selected by OSMO governance participants, allowing the stakeholders to formulate an incentivization strategy that best aligns with the long-term interests of the protocol.

## Transaction Fees
Transaction fees are paid by any user to post a transaction on the chain. The fee amount is determined by the computation and storage costs of the transaction. Minimum gas costs are determined by the proposer of a block in which the transaction is included. This transaction fee is distributed to OSMO stakers on the network.

Validators can choose which assets to accept for fees in the blocks that they propose, allowing users to pay for gas in almost any token listed on Osmosis. All accepted assets are converted back to OSMO before distribution, retaining this utility.

The list of tokens accepted for tx fees is **permissionless**. Head to the [Fee Token Whitelist Controller DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/osmo17eqe9dpglajwd48r65lasq3mftra5q4uxce525htyvjdp0q037vqpurhve/proposals).  
_the token must have reasonable liquidity, paired with $OSMO as a minimum requirement_

## Taker Fees
Osmosis charges a small taker fee on all trades with a 0.1% default.
Several routes have reductions or exemptions, which are managed by the [Protocol Fee Controller](https://daodao.zone/dao/osmo162wk8qc3w5s9hfs8dm76wrqnk6fjmsez2t4kk6zyugmrlzgds8sqfesmlm) subDAO.

Taker fees are initially collected in the asset provided as the entry point to the trade. 

Non-OSMO collected is divided, with 25% going to the Community Pool and 75% used to buyback OSMO before further distribution.

OSMO collected is distributed partially to stakers (30%) and partially burned (70%) to reduce the maximum supply of OSMO. 

## ProtoRev
The ProtoRev module mints and burns tokens in order to perform privileged arbitrage transactions onchain, ensuring prices are balanced across all liquidity sources. This happens within the same transaction and results in a net gain after the mint and burn from the arbitrage performed.

If a non-OSMO asset is recovered from this arbitrage, it is sent to the Community Pool as specified in [Proposal 709](https://daodao.zone/dao/osmosis/proposals/709).

If OSMO is recovered from this arbitrage, it is burned as specified in [Proposal 710](https://daodao.zone/dao/osmosis/proposals/710), permanently decreasing the Maximum Supply of 1 billion.
All permanent burns can be tracked by viewing the [Null Address](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/address/osmo1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqmcn030).

## Other Fees
The OSMO token is required as fees for several tasks on chain to prevent spam and encourage considered usage of features. All fees paid go to the Community Pool.

* Adding External Incentives to a pool: 50 OSMO
* Topping up External Incentives on an existing stream: 25 OSMO
